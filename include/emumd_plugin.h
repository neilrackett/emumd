 * Description: The interface between an emulator (Hatari, patched by
 *              hatari/) and a SidecarTridge Multi-device firmware built
 *              for the host as a .mdfw plugin (a shared library).
 *
 * The emulator loads the plugin, calls its entry point once, and from then
 * on routes the ST's cartridge-port reads to it: ROM4 ($FA0000-$FAFFFF)
 * returns a word from the firmware's 64 KB window, ROM3 ($FB0000-$FBFFFF)
 * hands the firmware the low 16 address bits, which is how the ST sends it
 * commands. The firmware runs in between on the emulator's thread (and on
 * a second thread if it starts its second core), so to the emulated ST the
 * Multi-device is infinitely fast.
 *
 * GPL-2.0-or-later so that it can be built into Hatari. Both sides include
 * this same file; build-hatari.sh copies it into Hatari's sources.
